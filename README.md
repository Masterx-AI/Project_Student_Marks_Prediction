# AI/ML Project: Student Marks Prediction ðŸ“š

### Description:

The data consists of Marks of students including their study time & number of courses. The dataset is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Properties of the Dataset:** \
Number of Instances: 100\
Number of Attributes: 3 including the target variable.

The project is simple yet challenging as it is has very limited features & samples. Can you build regression model to capture all the patterns in the dataset, also maitaining the generalisability of the model?

### Objective:
- Understand the Dataset & perform the necessary cleanup.
- Build Regression models & fine-tune the hyperparamters to predict the student marks.
- Also evaluate the models & compare thier respective scores like R2, RMSE, etc.
